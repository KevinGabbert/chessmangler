## This is the Home Page for **Chess Mangler** ##

This is a Web Application with a JQuery front end, and C# back end intended to allow a user to set up chess pieces with custom functionality (using an JSON "Rules File") where a user can set up their own **boards**, **rules** and **pieces**.  So, basically, you can **Mangle** the chess rules pretty badly if you set your mind to it.

This program will contain some chess variants templates set up, but the user to can either change the functionality of the pieces or create a new chess variant.

Some examples: Four Player chess, Monster Chess, Chess960, Thai Makruk, Mongolian Shatar, etc..

There are innumerable possibilities detailed here:

Hopefully, a large number of chess variants can be supported. Later versions are intended to support oddly shaped boards, multiple boards, 3D cubes, and all manner of oddness that the chess paradigm has been assigned to.

**Development Details**

The development SVN for this project is hosted elsewhere. The SVN here at Google Code is a mirror of it. I will be sync'ing both at periodic intervals.

Would you like to help? Send me an email to get involved. (I do have an existing set of code standards and architecture, so keep that in mind, however I am flexible on that, especially if you are looking to add new functionality.)

If you want to visit the Site (still under construction), it will likely be in some state of not-being-done-yet, but you can see whats going on.  http://www.chessmangler.com

This project is currently Alpha (7.25.12)
